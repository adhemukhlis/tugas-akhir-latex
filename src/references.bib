abstract = {Spreadsheets have long been recognized as important tools for end-user computing. This research explores their use within business organizations. A survey was carried out to investigate the relationships among tasks, spreadsheet proficiency, usage, and satisfaction. The results suggested that the spreadsheet proficiency can have a greater impact on the tasks than the task can have on the spreadsheet proficiency. It was also found that spreadsheet users often do not use many of the commonly available spreadsheet features, and they do not appear inclined to use other software packages for their tasks, even if these packages might be more suitable. The proficiency of the spreadsheet users was not found to be related to the importance of the decisions being taken as a result of the spreadsheet analyses.},

@article{Rajalingham2000,
abstract = { This paper presents work conducted towards the development of an effective software engineering-based methodology for integrity control in the process of spreadsheet development. Various approaches and concepts within the discipline of software engineering are investigated. The proposed methodology consists of a set of coherent stages incorporating relevant software engineering techniques and principles. The framework for spreadsheet quality control is mainly aimed at addressing the widespread problem of spreadsheet errors. This paper elaborately discusses the application of relevant software engineering techniques and principles in the construction of spreadsheet models, accompanied and supported by appropriate examples. The principles and techniques of tree-based formula representation, unique definition of spreadsheet elements, and separation of data and operations are among the main features explored.},

@article{Powell2009,
abstract = {All users of spreadsheets struggle with the problem of errors. Errors are thought to be prevalent in spreadsheets, and in some instances they have cost organizations millions of dollars. In a previous study of 50 operational spreadsheets we found errors in 0.8{\%} to 1.8{\%} of all formula cells, depending on how errors are defined. In the current study we estimate the quantitative impacts of errors in 25 operational spreadsheets from five different organizations. Within these 25 spreadsheets we identified 381 potential errors, of which 117 (31{\%}) were confirmed as errors by the developers of the spreadsheet. Among these confirmed errors, 47 (40{\%}) had no quantitative impact on the results. Among the remaining 70 confirmed errors, the largest error was {\$}100Â million; however, 9 of the 25 spreadsheets tested had no errors at all. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spreadsheets play an important role for managerial accountants. For these practitioners, spreadsheets are necessary tools for traditional responsibilities such as planning, budgeting, forecasting as well as newer decision-making responsibilities. Responsibilities for managerial accounting practitioners have shifted from a transaction-based focus to an emphasis on decision support, planning, and control. Managerial accountants are expected to be key members of decision making and cross-functional teams outside the accounting area. Spreadsheets are major tools for meeting these new responsibilities. However, there is a significant gap in the literature with respect to what features of spreadsheets are most relevant for these new responsibilities. The purpose of this exploratory research is to provide evidence as to (a) what features of spreadsheets managerial accountants use, and (b) what features of spreadsheets new hires are expected to use.},
